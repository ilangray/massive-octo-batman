Overview
-----
uSLIS is intended to replace Tufts University's current information system, iSIS, which is hopelessly outdated and painfully frustrating to use. In response to iSIS's many points of failures, we attempt to provide a web app that allows students to search and register for classes in an intuitive way that will not frustrated or drive students away. We hope to further provide more insight into the classes Tufts offers by providing intelligent search features.
