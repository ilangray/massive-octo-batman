Among cultural commentators, writers, artists, and scholars, two opposing pictures of the city persist. In  one, Los Angeles is a laboratory for exchange and negotiation, in which a plurality of races and ethnicities contribute to a rich and diverse polycultural landscape. In the other view, the city is an intellectual wasteland, characterized by striking socioeconomic and racial exploitation and exclusion, environmental destruction, and the end of public space. This seminar aims to explore – and complicate – this “sunshine vs. noir” perspective, by examining secondary and theoretical texts from Mike Davis, Kevin Starr, Michael Sorkin, and Eric Avila, and by investigating the ways Los Angeles has been “envisioned” in memoir, fiction, film, and television, which will serve as our primary sources.

Arguments from human history, evolutionary biology, and political theory have been used to maintain the violent status quo. For nearly as long as there has been human violence however, thinkers and political activists have embraced theories of nonviolence – the rejection of violence in thought, speech, and deed – as productive ways to change their societies. The course will begin by defining nonviolence and its relationship to state-sponsored violence. In the course’s second movement we will examine how nonviolent philosophies can inform debates on social issues such as domestic violence, animal rights, and immigration. The final third of the course will orbit around a research paper in which students will apply philosophies of nonviolence read in class to a contemporary political, social, and cultural conflict of the student’s choice.

When we laugh, must we laugh at something or someone? Why do I sometimes feel such keen discomfort when watching reruns of I Love Lucy or The Office? Such notorious killjoys as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and Immanuel Kant have given their attention to humor, and their evaluations haven't always been positive. Some claim that laughter must necessarily be an expression of contempt for another, that enjoyment of comedy encourages coarseness of feeling and deadens our sympathy for others. These thinkers say that comedy transforms our neighbors' pain and humiliation into entertainment. Certainly, racist or sexist humor seems to operate on this principle, and as the saying goes –– most often attributed to Mel Brooks –– \"Tragedy is when I cut my finger; comedy is when you fall down an open manhole and die.\" However, there are also those who claim that laughter encourages human sympathy and community. Comedy, they claim, can both unite us in common understanding and help us get outside of our petty jealousies and prejudices by giving us a new perspective on the world. Humor, it turns out, may make us more able to care about each other and to understand our world. It may even be one of the more valuable forms of intellectual inquiry available to curious and sympathetic thinkers.This course sets out to investigate the relationship between our capacity to enjoy comedy and our ability to appreciate the experiences of others, and seeks to provide interested students the opportunity to sharpen their academic skills and to deepen their analytic habits of mind. We will examine the real and supposed tensions between comedy and sympathy by carefully considering key ideas from a variety of disciplines and by closely examining examples of humor from literature, the visual arts, and performances in television or film. The question of what we find funny and how we ought to regard that feeling offers ample opportunity to rigorously investigate examples of humor, to engage critically the often contentious scholarship that considers that question, and to produce original research suggesting some kind of answer to it over the course of three substantive essay assignments. Students will leave the course with experience in applying essential strategies for framing and working through analytic questions in writing, amply prepared to begin with confidence their scholastic careers at Brandeis.Mr. Plunkett","times":{"mon":"12:00PM-12:50PM","tues":"!","wed":"12:00PM-12:50PM","thurs":"12:00PM-12:50PM","fri":"!"},"tokens":["comedy","and","sympathy","university","writing","(comp","uws)","uws-12a","university writing (comp and uws)","plunkett","uws","12a"]},{"name":"Women and Gender in Culture and Society","prof":"Freeze","num":"WMGS-5A","dept":"Women's and Gender Studies","desc":"This interdisciplinary course introduces central concepts and topics in  the field of women's and gender studies.

But a few centuries ago, magicians in Renaissance Europe were real people of great learning and influence. Their expansive knowledge included virtually everything:  astronomy, mathematics, geometry, music, navigation, chemistry, herbal medicine and other varied topics. They even designed airplanes, submarines, robots, and methods of telecommunication which we mistakenly believe, are the inventions of our modern times! Many of these magicians, however, also suffered due to their unquenchable desire for knowledge. Many risked their lives attempting to know things that had been forbidden by the Church of the time.  To understand these paradoxical figures, we will read the works of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, William Shakespeare's Tempest, and Francis Bacon's New Atlantis.

This is a question we will take up in this course, particularly as it relates to the British novel. Throughout the semester we will focus our attention on three novels in which violence is a central concern. We will read Aphra Behn’s Oroonoko, Mary Shelley’sFrankenstein, and Baroness Orczy’s The Scarlet Pimpernel, each written in and representing a different historical context. We will consider violence as it exists within each of these novels, and also what emerges in discussing violence in literature more generally when we consider these novels collectively. The guiding questions of our discussions will include the following: how is violence manifested within these texts? What are the levels on which violence can be represented in the novel? How should we contextualize our discussions of violence in the novel, and what should the terms of these discussions be?As we work to explore these issues, we will also be working to gain the skills necessary to write a successful college-level essay. Thus, this course will be structured around three major writing assignments, in each of which we will explore the relationship between violence and literature. In the Close Reading Essay, you will develop an argument aboutOroonoko through a meticulous and sustained attention to the text. In the Lens Essay, you will develop an argument about Frankenstein using the writings of Sigmund Freud.

How is power negotiated and transferred between characters? A decade later, the reverberations of ribald humor in Portnoy’s Complaint extended beyond the literary scene, shaking communities across America.

We will use Sigmund Freud’s theories of emotional ambivalence and the Oedipus complex to illuminate Roth’s texts.There will be three required essays for this course: for the first essay, students will do a close reading of one of Roth’s short stories; for the second essay, students will use Freud’s theories of emotional ambivalence and the Oedipus complex to illuminate Portnoy’s Complaint; for the third essay, students will choose to read American Pastoral, The Plot Against America, or The Human Stain and write a research paper that analyzes a range of critical response to one of these works.Ms. Minder","times":{"mon":"9:00AM-9:50AM","tues":"!","wed":"9:00AM-9:50AM","thurs":"9:00AM-9:50AM","fri":"!"},"tokens":["philip","roth's","early","complaints","university","writing","(comp","and","uws)","uws-25b","university writing (comp and uws)","minder","uws","25b"]},{"name":"Cells and Organisms","prof":"Kosinski-Collins","num":"BIOL-15B","dept":"Postbaccalaureate Premedical Studies","desc":"May not be taken for credit by students who took BIOL 22b in prior years.Introduces contemporary biology with an emphasis on cells, organs, and organ systems.

Nuclear apocalypse.  The Rapture.  Zombies.  More and more, our relationship to the apocalyptic takes the form of a complex mixture of fascination, attraction, and horror.  From family-sized nuclear fallout bunkers to do-it-yourself zombie survival kits, entire industries have emerged for the purpose of nurturing and exploiting our fantasies of an end-of-days event.  But what do these fantasies reveal about us—about the economic inequalities, social injustices, political ideologies that characterize so much of Western culture?  In this course, we will attempt to understand particular visions of apocalypse as symptoms of a set of deeper problems facing Western liberal democracy.  We will begin by watching several episodes of The Twilight Zone, to examine how stories of nuclear holocaust serve to reaffirm ‘traditional’ American values.  We will follow this by placing sections of Alan Moore’s graphic novel Watchmen in conversation with Theodor Adorno’s arguments about the meaning of art after the holocaust.  We will ask how the range of ethical frameworks modeled in the text struggle to understand a man-made apocalyptic event.  Finally, we will use Alfonso Cuaron’s Children of Men as a starting place to research the emerging threats posed to Western culture by biotechnology, unchecked immigration, population explosion, and the totalitarian state.Mr. Cavender","times":{"mon":"9:00AM-9:50AM","tues":"!","wed":"9:00AM-9:50AM","thurs":"9:00AM-9:50AM","fri":"!"},"tokens":["living","in","the","end","times","university","writing","(comp","and","uws)","uws-27a","university writing (comp and uws)","cavender","uws","27a"]},{"name":"David Hume","prof":"Sherman","num":"PHIL-166A","dept":"Philosophy","desc":"An in-depth examination on the philosophical ideas of the eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher David Hume, covering his views in metaphysics and epistemology, his philosophy of mind, his moral and political philosophy, and his philosophy of religion.

This relatively brief period witnessed the genesis of Bauhausarchitecture, the dramas of Bertoldt Brecht, and the decadent cabaret culture of 1920s Berlin.  The vibrancy of Weimar culture is made even more curious by its precarious historical location, sandwiched between Germany’s disastrous end to World War One and the even more calamitous rise of National Socialism (1933-1945).Why, at a time when German democracy was arguably at its zenith, did an originally small right-wing fringe movement (National Socialism) eventually gain political control and establish a fascist genocidal regime?  Was the Weimar period a “failed experiment in democracy”, or was the Third Reich a probable development with clear antecedents in Germany’s cultural and political past?This course will specifically focus on Bertoldt Brecht’s The Threepenny Opera (1928), Ernst Junger’s memoir Storm of Steel (1924), and excerpts from Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto, as well as some of the more well-known National Socialist publications.

Seems fairly obvious, but abolitionist reformers in the first half of the nineteenth century spilled a great deal of ink illustrating that point through a variety of means.  These men and women worked to overcome an American culture whose attitudes towards slavery ranged from ambivalence to sympathy, and a Southern intelligentsia increasingly committed to portraying slavery as a positive good.  This course will explore those methods, from rhetoric to fiction to dramatic slave narrative.  We will begin by reading Harriet Beecher Stowe’s tremendously influential novel, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, and exploring the impact it had as a sentimental antislavery tract.  Students will discuss how Stowe used fiction as an antislavery tool.  We will then read several narratives of escaped slaves who put their autobiographies to work for the antislavery cause.  The second major assignment of the course will ask students to critically examine one of these narratives through a literary criticism lens.  Finally, we will turn to the rhetoric deployed by slavery’s most vocal and radical opponents, the abolitionists, in order to sway their audiences.  The final assignment of the course will be a research paper in which students seek out contemporary abolitionist literature and critically examine their argumentative tactics.Mr. Campbell","times":{"mon":"5:00PM-6:20PM","tues":"!","wed":"5:00PM-6:20PM","thurs":"!","fri":"!"},"tokens":["a","self-evident","wrong:","selling","antislavery","university","writing","(comp","and","uws)","uws-3b","university writing (comp and uws)","campbell","uws","3b"]},{"name":"Introduction to Chinese Music and Its Development in the Modern Era","prof":"Chang","num":"MUS-4A","dept":"Music","desc":"Open to all students; no musical background is required.A general introduction to the history and practice of Chinese music, with a focus on existing musical activities.

Is he a superhero? A supervillain? A particularly troubled fashion victim? In the world of the Superhero, everything depends on being able to successfully make the call, but how is this decision made? What is it that marks the difference between the good guy, the bad guy, and the random guy on the street? More importantly, what makes these traits so important? In this class, we will engage with a series of texts, from comic books to film, in order to interrogate the markers of good and evil, and what these markers tell us about how we conceptualize ourselves. From Lex Luthor to Dr. Horrible, Superman to Sylar, we will interrogate how notions of good and evil form along the boundaries of race, class, gender and sexuality. Questions we will address will include, what is a hero? How do notions of masculinity impact our perception of “goodness” and the heroic? How does a Superhero register differently from a Superheroine? Why can’t the villain get the girl? And lastly, can you have a gay superhero? Ultimately, this class proposes to explore how we use these “Super” characters to define the limits and the possibilities of our own existence.To this end, and as the course is a University Writing Seminar, students will use critical theory and cultural texts to develop their own readings of these characters while developing their analytical writing skills within the university. This course will help you cultivate the necessary faculties for writing successful academic essays, which will serve you throughout your career at Brandeis. You will develop a critical vocabulary for thinking about the process of composition and revision, and cultivate crucial research skills that will help you make the most of the information resources available at Brandeis.I will stress that this course, though focusing on non-traditional genres of text, will emphasize a strong theoretical ethic and a rather heavy reading load.

The Redcoats are coming!” The following day at Lexington the “shot heard around the world” was fired in the shadow of the city. One year later, atop Bunker Hill faced by onrushing British soldiers, William Prescott ordered his men, “Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes.” Even earlier James Otis contended, “Taxation without representation was tyranny.” These immortal words, some of the most famous in American history, were all uttered by the voices of Boston’s citizens. The city of Boston has been nicknamed “the cradle of Revolution” for its crucial role in the American War of Independence. The city led the charge for freedom that culminated in the American Revolution. The battles that took place in and around Boston helped define and establish the United States. Bostonians, including such notables as John Adams, Samuel Adams, and John Hancock, led the ideological charge against Great Britain. This course will follow the initial “battles” for liberty (the Stamp Act Riots, the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, and the Powder Alarm) to the true military battles (Lexington and Concord, Bunker Hill, and the Siege of Boston) that helped spur independence. By examining these events, we will learn how Boston became inescapably intertwined with the history and memory of not just the war, but the spirit of America.This course will be based on writing and research, and is designed to improve your historical knowledge and composition skills. Drawing from period papers on these battles, as well as from the historical and literary works from their centennial era and the modern day, it will feature a close reading assignment on a primary text. A subsequent essay comparing a primary document to a piece of secondary historical literature will follow. The culmination of the semester will center on an original student-selected research essay about one of Boston’s battles. Emphasis will be placed on style, tone, grammar, and organization. Through individual conferences and peer reviews, this course will enhance your academic writing.Mr. Smith","times":{"mon":"5:00PM-6:20PM","tues":"!","wed":"5:00PM-6:20PM","thurs":"!","fri":"!"},"tokens":["the","battles","of","boston","university","writing","(comp","and","uws)","uws-8a","university writing (comp and uws)","smith","uws","8a"]},{"name":"Tikkun Olam/Repairing the World: Service and Social Justice in Theory and Practice","prof":"Levisohn","num":"NEJS-171B","dept":"Near Eastern and Judaic Studies","desc":"What does tikkun olam mean?

When we laugh, must we laugh at something or someone? Why do I sometimes feel such keen discomfort when watching reruns of I Love Lucy or The Office? Such notorious killjoys as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and Immanuel Kant have given their attention to humor, and their evaluations haven't always been positive. Some claim that laughter must necessarily be an expression of contempt for another, that enjoyment of comedy encourages coarseness of feeling and deadens our sympathy for others. These thinkers say that comedy transforms our neighbors' pain and humiliation into entertainment. Certainly, racist or sexist humor seems to operate on this principle, and as the saying goes –– most often attributed to Mel Brooks –– \"Tragedy is when I cut my finger; comedy is when you fall down an open manhole and die.\" However, there are also those who claim that laughter encourages human sympathy and community. Comedy, they claim, can both unite us in common understanding and help us get outside of our petty jealousies and prejudices by giving us a new perspective on the world. Humor, it turns out, may make us more able to care about each other and to understand our world. It may even be one of the more valuable forms of intellectual inquiry available to curious and sympathetic thinkers.This course sets out to investigate the relationship between our capacity to enjoy comedy and our ability to appreciate the experiences of others, and seeks to provide interested students the opportunity to sharpen their academic skills and to deepen their analytic habits of mind. We will examine the real and supposed tensions between comedy and sympathy by carefully considering key ideas from a variety of disciplines and by closely examining examples of humor from literature, the visual arts, and performances in television or film. The question of what we find funny and how we ought to regard that feeling offers ample opportunity to rigorously investigate examples of humor, to engage critically the often contentious scholarship that considers that question, and to produce original research suggesting some kind of answer to it over the course of three substantive essay assignments. Students will leave the course with experience in applying essential strategies for framing and working through analytic questions in writing, amply prepared to begin with confidence their scholastic careers at Brandeis.Mr. Plunkett","times":{"mon":"1:00PM-1:50PM","tues":"!","wed":"1:00PM-1:50PM","thurs":"1:00PM-1:50PM","fri":"!"},"tokens":["comedy","and","sympathy","university","writing","(comp","uws)","uws-12a","university writing (comp and uws)","plunkett","uws","12a"]},{"name":"Beginning Italian","prof":"Servino","num":"ITAL-10A","dept":"Italian Studies","desc":"Prerequisite: For students with no previous study of Italian.
